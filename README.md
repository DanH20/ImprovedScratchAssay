# ImprovedScratchAssay
The Scratcher went through numerous iterations. The final form is in two pieces a handle which can be printed form any standard rigid resin. I used an Elegoo Mars Ultra 4 and 3DMaterials standard resin.

The tips must be printed from 3D materials Superflex resin. This is to insure that tissue treated plates do not get large scratches to the coating which make it hard to image later. The Superflex resin is soft enough to not damage the plate but still remove cells.

Printing as one piece or using harder resins for the tips leads to the scratches on the bottom of the plate.

The lid is meant to be laser cut from acrylic, the current width is designed for the scratcher to have minimal side to side movement while still being able to scratch, the width can be adjusted to create a second lid for marking the back of the plate with a pin around the scratch. When I have done this I have sized it to be 1mm wider than the width of whatever pen I am usings contact point with the lid. This insures a 1mm marked lane with a 0.5mm scratch in the middle of it allowing consistent visualization.
